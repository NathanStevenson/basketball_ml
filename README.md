# Predicting Basketball Scores with Machine Learning

This was my first time experimenting with ML and I followed a tutorial found at:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egTylm6C2is. The final model from the tutorial is able
to predict with 64.9% accuracy which team will win the next game.

## Future Plans
1. Modify the current code to try and get the model up to mid to high 70% accuracy.
2. Watch another machine learning tutorial to get a deeper understanding of how it works and how to perform these tasks better.
3. Watch a ML tutorial about predicting a continuous variable such as the price or duration of time to complete a task.
4. Use the above knowledge to write my own ML program to predict certain statistics about NBA games such as total points scored,
as well as potentially doing some sports betting information such as player specific stats and maybe even extending beyond NBA games.
