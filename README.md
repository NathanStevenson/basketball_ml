# Predicting Basketball Scores with Machine Learning

This was my first time experimenting with ML and I followed a tutorial found at:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egTylm6C2is. The plan is once I get an understanding of ML,
to expand the base code from the tutorial and add new features such as predicting players
statistics and potentially even expanding the project to cover other sports.
